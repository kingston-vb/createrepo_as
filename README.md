createrepo_as
=============

createrepo_as was a tool that allowed us to create AppStream metadata
from a directory of packages. It has now been absorbed into the parent
libappstream-glib project which can be found here:
https://github.com/hughsie/appstream-glib

During the import, the createrepo_as binary was renamed to
appstream-builder, but the arguments and the behaviour of the tool
remain unchanged.

Sorry for any inconvenience.
